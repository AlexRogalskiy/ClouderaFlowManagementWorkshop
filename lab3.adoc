== Bonus Lab 3 - Use NiFi to call REST API, transform, route and store the data

Pick any REST API of your choice, but I have walked through this one to grab a number of weather stations reports.

We are going to build a GenerateFlowFile to feed our REST calls.

So we are using ${url} which will be one of these.   Feel free to pick your favorite airports or locations near you.   https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/index.xml

If you wish to choose your own data adventure, you can pick one of these others.   You will have to build your own table if you wish to store it.  They return CSV, JSON or XML, since we have record processors we don't care.  Just know which you pick.

You can now use Apache Hue to query your tables and do some weather analytics.   When we are upserting into Kudu we are ensuring no duplicate reports for a weather station and observation time.

select `location`, weather, temp_f, wind_string, dewpoint_string, latitude, longitude, observation_time
from weatherkudu
order by observation_time desc, station_id asc
