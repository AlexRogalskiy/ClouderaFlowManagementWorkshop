== Bonus Lab 3 - Use NiFi to call REST API, transform, route and store the data

Pick any REST API of your choice, but I have walked through this one to grab a number of weather stations reports.

We are going to build a GenerateFlowFile to feed our REST calls.

So we are using ${url} which will be one of these.   Feel free to pick your favorite airports or locations near you.   https://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/index.xml

If you wish to choose your own data adventure, you can pick one of these others.   You will have to build your own table if you wish to store it.  They return CSV, JSON or XML, since we have record processors we don't care.  Just know which you pick.

* https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cjae-szjv/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD
* https://api.weather.gov/stations/KTTN/observations/current                                                                  * https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/csv/data_reports_monthly_indicators.csv
* https://docs.coincap.io/?version=latest

Then we will use SplitJSON to split the JSON records into single rows.

Then use EvaluateJSONPath to extract the URL.

Now we are going to call those REST URLs with InvokeHTTP.

Then we are going to run a query to convert these and route based on our queries.

Example query on the current NOAA weather observations to look for temperature in fareneheit below 60 degrees.   You can make a query with any of the fields in the where cause.  Give it a try!

SELECT * FROM FLOWFILE
WHERE temp_f <= 60

Now we are splitting into three concurrent paths.   This shows the power of Apache NiFi.   We will write to Kudu, HDFS and Kafka.

For the results of our cold path (temp_f <=60), we will write to a Kudu table.

image::images/putkudu.png[width=800]

Kudu Masters: edge2ai-1.dim.local:7051
Table Name:  impala::default.weatherkudu
Record Reader:   Infer Json Tree Reader
Kudu Operation Type: UPSERT

Before you run this, go to Hue and build the table.

TBLPROPERTIES ('kudu.num_tablet_replicas' = '1');

Let it run and query it.

The Second fork is to Kafka, this will be for the 'all' path.



[source,sql]
----
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `weather` 
(`credit` STRING, `credit_url` STRING, `image` STRUCT<`url`:STRING, `title`:STRING, `link`:STRING>, `suggested_pickup` STRING, `suggested_pickup_period` BIGINT,
`location` STRING, `station_id` STRING, `latitude` DOUBLE, `longitude` DOUBLE, `observation_time` STRING, `observation_time_rfc822` STRING, `weather` STRING, `temperature_string` STRING, 
`temp_f` DOUBLE, `temp_c` DOUBLE, `relative_humidity` BIGINT, `wind_string` STRING, `wind_dir` STRING, `wind_degrees` BIGINT, `wind_mph` DOUBLE, `wind_gust_mph` DOUBLE, `wind_kt` BIGINT,

You can now use Apache Hue to query your tables and do some weather analytics.   When we are upserting into Kudu we are ensuring no duplicate reports for a weather station and observation time.

[source,sql]

select `location`, weather, temp_f, wind_string, dewpoint_string, latitude, longitude, observation_time
from weatherkudu
order by observation_time desc, station_id asc
